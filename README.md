Flow based programming visual editor in python

1. The editor enables you to define an input node with custom data type (double click the input node)
2. Create custom logic nodes.
3. Double click the logic node to open a custom code panel.
4. Inside the panel you can view all the nodes and values as input to that logic node.
5. Currently the logic node has only one output enabled. So inside your custom loigic the data that you want to pass to the nest node define it like -> result=<your variable/data> as the value stored in the result will be passed to the next node.
6. Output node displays the data passed to it as well as can be used as an input to another logic node.

I am working on features to remove the nodes/connections and even save the project.
Feel free to reach out, customize the code & drop your thoughts.
